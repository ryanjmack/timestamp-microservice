# Timestamp Microservice API

This is a simple Node.js API service. When the API is properly used it returns a Unix Timestamp in JSON. Invalid inputs return JSON as well, just with an error message instead of a timestamp!


## Getting Started

Check out the [live demo](https://ryanmack-timestamp-api.herokuapp.com/)!

Directions for usage are found on the demo.

## Built With

* Node.js
* Express
* SCSS
* Gulp for SCSS pre-processing and CSS prefixing.


## Final Thoughts

This was a simple API project that was just a warmup to get used to deploying a simple Node.js web app. It wasn't inherently difficult, configuration and deployment was more difficult than the actual programming of it.
